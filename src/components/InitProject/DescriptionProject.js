        This project is an example of a website for a barbershop.
        This is a poorly designed design template, and my skills
        are not high enough to adapt it to small screens, even computers,
        so it is recommended to open it on a widescreen monitor for proper display.<br></br>
        In general, this is a template from a telegram channel that was proposed in a practical assignment.
        It was interesting to get acquainted with
        the React framework using the example of implementing this template
        and making a prototype of a website for a barbersop.
